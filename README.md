# SIA_expectaton_Urcia

What I expect is about to learn on how to design and to know different computers connections and components, also how to figure out what the systems needs and how it functions.

I'd like to understand more about system integration and architecture because it has many topics I didn't know. I am excited to gain knwoledge in this course.

I believe this course will help me understand technology better and make systems more reliable and efficient.
